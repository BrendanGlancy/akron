-- A Modest Proposal -

For preventing the children of poor people in Ireland,
from being a burden on their parents or country,
and for making them beneficial to the public

The author thinks beggers make the country look bad, Dr. Jonathan
Swift

He estimates there are 120 thousand poor children born a year at the time 
of writing
It's impossible to give all of these children jobs, or build them 
houses
Swift suggest that people eat these children because they are delicious
He includes different ways to prepare the children for consumption

He says they will skin the children and make gloves and boots
"butchers we may be assured will not be wanting"

It's supposed to be satire mocking the cure all solutions people have 
purposed to help with Irelands economic troubles

This solution is aimed to help with unemployment and overpopulation
