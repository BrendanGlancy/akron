 This project has been changed in comparison to the version from the second edition. 
 
 What has changed? The second edition version required database access. This
 edition's version no longer requires this: instead, the data is provided as a hard-coded array
 (in the file data.inc.php) so that the student/reader can concentrate on the session aspect
 of the project.
 
If you'd like to practice some additional session handling, implement as well the add to cart functionality.
