# Chapter 1

What is a system:
**A collection of part that work together to achieve a goal**

What is an information system:
**A system that deals with information**

## Three components of computer information system:

- Computer
- Network
- Data

## Basic Concepts of system analysis and design

**Software**
- System Software, talks to the hardware
- Application Software, User interaction software

**Computer Application (App)** - a computer software program that executes on a computing device to carry out a specific set of functions 
- Modest Scope

**Information System** - a set of interrelated components that collects, processes and provides as output the information needed to complete business tasks
- Broader scope than "app"
- Includes database and related manual processes

## Analysis 

- System analysis
    - What is required for the new system to solve a problem
- Systems design
    - How the system will operate to solve a problem

### Software Development 

User stories are a key part of agile software development. They are short, simple descriptions of a software feature or functionality from the perspective of a user. User stories are written in plain language and are intended to be easily accessible. They are used to capture requirements in an agile project and help the development team understand the needs and expectations of the users.

This is where we decide what features our software product needs, and then we imagine how that will effect the design **required features effect the design** think of a truck and a race car

Its the same for information systems, based on the features which you get from user stories, you develop the design requirements

### Structured Analysis and Design

**Waterfall** Approach to Software development
- Too ridged
- Focuses on compartmentalizing projects into several phases.

**Agile** Approach
- Focuses on self-adaptive processes with an emphasis on individual talents.

### Different types on Information Systems

Transaction Processing System (EX. ATM)

Combine a Transaction Processing System and data analytics system types to provide overall support systems

**Management information systems** (MIS): Help middle managers plan and control workflow.

**Decision support systems** (DSS): Computer-based systems that support business or organizational decision-making.

**Executive information systems** (EIS): A type of DSS that helps senior executives make decisions.

### The SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) generally follows these seven stages:

- Plan and brainstorm
- Analyze requirements
- Design the mockups
- Develop the code
- Test the product
- Implement and launch the product
- Maintenance

**Project** - a planned undertaking that has a beginning and end and that produces some definite result

- Used to develop an information system
- Requires knowledge of systems analysis and systems design tools and techniques

### Agile Development 

Software Development
- More like inventing a gadget then building a house
- Big requirements upfront not a viable option
- So instead "Build a little, review a little, revise a little"


**Scrum** is an agile methodology that involves a small team led by a Scrum master. The team works in short cycles called sprints. The team meets daily to discuss tasks and any obstacles that need to be removed. The Scrum master's job is to remove any obstacles to getting work done.
