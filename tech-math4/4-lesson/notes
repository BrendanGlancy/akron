-- Lesson 1.7 Lecture --

This week we will learn how to combine functions and Inverse functions

Test over unit one will be tuesday the 28th in person

Combining functions:

1) Preforming basic arithmethic (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
Division)

2) Composition of functions (special type of operation with function)

Addtion:
    (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)

Division: When doing divison you will sometimes have an undefined function
if x is subsititued for a value which makes the denominator 0
    (f/g)(x) = f(x)/g(x)

Multiplication:
(Use foil)
    (f*g)(x) = f(x)*g(x)

Subtraction:
    f - g = f(x) - g(x)

Composition of Functions
is not communitive

Given two functions f(x) and g(x) we have the following two definitions

1) The composition of f(x) and g(x) (note the order here) is,
    (f o g)(x) = f[g(x)]

2) The composition of g(x) and f(x) (again, note the order) is,
  (g o f)(x) = g[f(x)]

-- Lesson 1.8 --

Inverse Functions

Given two one-to-one functions f(x) and g(x)
f o g(x) = and g o f(x) = x

then we say f(x) and g(x) are inverses of each other
More specifically we will say that g(x) is the inverse of f(x) and denote
it by g(x) = f^-1(x)

Likewise we could also say that f(x) is the inverse of g(x) and denote it by
f(x) = g^-1(x)

One to one function, different inputs have different outputs
Have to do verticle and horizontal line test

We don't go into detail proving if a function is one to one in this class

First you replace f(x) with y, then you replace all x's with y and all y's
with x

Domain of f = Range of f^-1 and Range of f = domain of f^-1

To graph the inverse just switch the points (a,b) to (b,a)
