Complex Fractions

a Fraction over a fraction

If P, Q, and K are polynomials, and Q != 0 and K != 0 then,
P/Q = PK/QK and P/Q = (P/K)/(Q/K)

Flip one of the fractions over and multiply

You must be able to identify the main fraction bar
Usually bigger than the others

When you have addtion or subtraction in the numerator or
denominator of your complex fraction, you must find the LCD of 
the fraction in which you adding then combine them

You can also find the LCD of all the fractions in the complex fraction
Instead of starting with just the numerators LCD then the denominators 
LCD 

-- Lesson 1.10 --

Given the value of a function at different points, calculat the average 
rate of change of a function for the interval between two values x1
and x2

A rate of change describes how an output quantity changes relative to the 
change in the input quantity. The units on a rate of change are 
"outputs per units"

The average rate of change between two input values is the total change of 
the function values (output values) divided by tyhe change in the input
values

delta x / delta y = (f(x2) - f(x1)) / (x2 - x1)

You want to find the average rate of change, and decribe it as a function

Average Rate of change between two points on a curve (AROC) between two 
points (a,f(a)) and (a + h, f(a + h)) on the curve of f is the slope
of the line connecting the two points and is given by AROC

(f(a + h) - f(a)) / h

Definiton of Instantaneous Rate of Change 

The instantaneous rate of change, of a function at f at x = a is given by

f'(a) = lim h -> 0 (f(a + h) - f(a)) / h

The expression f(a + h) - f(a) / h is called the difference quotient

We use the difference quotient to evaluate the limit of the rate of change
of the function as h approaches 0
