Documentry of how American do well dispite relatively low scores on international test

If you control for a number of factors the United States has a very good education system

## Reign of Error

Started by saying we need better testing standards, Americans need to improve education

Changed her mind about 15 years ago and she wants to tear down testing standards

Tear it down, but it's not like there's nothing valuable that has come from it
## Do these standards have any net positive effect

In my opinion, no they do not

Students should learn more specialization, tailored to their interest. 

Pay teachers more, teach each student at their own pace
