-- Lesson 3 notes --

Increasing, Decreasing, and Continuous Functions

There can be increasing parts of a graphed function, decreasing parts
and turning points where the graph is change from increasing to decreasing or
vice versa

You can have a relative maxium, like a turning point on a function where 
the absolute maxium is oo, same for minimums

Relative maxium point will be coordinate, Relative maxium value is just a 
number

If your Abosolute max or min is oo or -oo, then you say DNE (does not exsits)

When you have a constant, don't use an ordered pair; describe it as (x,x)
x where constant starts to x where constant ends 

Local Minima and Local Maxima:

    A function f is an increasing function on an open interval if f(b) > f(a)
    for any two input values a and b in the given interval where b > a

    A function f is a decreasing function on an open interval if f(b) < f(a) 
    for any two input values a and b in the given interval where b > a

    A function of f has a local maxium at x = b if there exsits an interval 
    (a,c) with a < b < c such that, for x in the interval (a,c), f(x) <= f(b).
    Likewise, f has a local maximum at x = b if there exsits an interval (a, c)
    with a < b < c such that, for any x in the interval (a, c), f(x) >= f(b)

Abosolute Maxima and Minima:

    The Absolute maxium of f at x = c f(c) where f(c) >= f(x) for all 
    x in the domain of f

    The Absolute minimum of f at x =d if f(d) where f(d) <= f(x) for all x
    in the domain of f

We spent the first 15 minutes going over old homework that I got 100% on

Local extremum and relative extremum:

In the window settings you can change what you see on the graphing, when
graphing with calculator

If you have find the relative min and max 4x^{5}-3x^{3}-2x of this function 
You have to approximate

You can use the trace point to approximate

-- Thursday 1.6 lesson --

We look at symmetry in this lesson

Even - a function is even if and only if its graph is symmetric with respect
to the y-axis.
f(-x) = f(x)

Odd - a function is odd if and only if its graph is symmetric with respect 
to the origin 
f(-x) = -f(x)

A function is never even and odd at the same time, but we can have a 
function that is neither

First test over unit one is in week 6 

Functions cannot have x axis symmetry
They don't pass the verticle line test if they are reflected over the 
x axis

When checking if even or odd, you don't plug in values for the variables
You cannot distribute a negetive to both the numerator and denominator
because that would make the fraction positive

You need to play with functions that are fractions, you can multiply
the numerator and denominator by -1 if they appear to be opposite, 
then you can prove even or odd algeabracily
