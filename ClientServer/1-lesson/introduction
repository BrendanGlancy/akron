# Introduction

This class is based around web developement.
Internet vs the World Wide Web
- The Internet is a network of computers and devices that are interconnected by a network of links.
- The World Wide Web is a network of websites that are interconnected by a network of links.

The world wide web or web for short are the pages you see when you're online. The internet is the network of connected computers that the web works on. Think of the internet as the roads that connect towns and cities together.

### A web application can have up to 5 layers
- Web browser
- Web server
- Application server
- Business logic
- Database server

## Two-tiered client server model
- An example of this would be a database, and a server acting as a database management system. Connected to a network of computers

## Business Logic Considerations
- data security
  - Providing limited access to various parts of the data or to various taks that may be performed on the data
  - Implemented by granting user access privileges to certain parts of the data
- data integrity
  - Ensures that the data is not corrupted or tampered with
  - Implemented by checking the data against a checksum
- centralized control
  - Ensures that the data is not manipulated by a third party
  - Implemented by having the data be stored in a central location
- scalability / proper distribution of work
  - Ensures that the data is distributed evenly across the network
  - Implemented by having the data be stored in a distributed system

## Client Server vs database desktop development
- Client server is a model that allows for the separation of the client from the server.
- Database desktop development is a model that allows for the separation of the database from the desktop.
