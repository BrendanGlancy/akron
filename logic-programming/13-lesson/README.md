**Question:**
Which of the sorting algorithms discussed makes several passes through an array and causes the larger values to move gradually toward the end of the array with each pass?

**Answer:**
Bubble Sort

## 9.2
**Question:**
One of the sorting algorithms discussed works like this: It begins by sorting the first two elements of the array, which becomes a sorted subset. Then the third element is moved to its correct position relative to the first two elements. At that point the first three elements become the sorted subset. This process continues with the fourth and subsequent elements until the entire array is sorted. Which algorithm is this?

**Answer:**
Insertion Sort

## 9.3
**Question:**
One of the sorting algorithms discussed works like this: The smallest value in the array is located and moved to element 0. Then the next smallest value is located and moved to element 1. This process continues until all of the elements have been placed in their proper order. Which algorithm i this?

**Answer:**
Selection Sorts
