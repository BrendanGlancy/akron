Yet, the Madonna and Child introduces a new naturalistic trend in painting. Instead of making the blessing gesture of a philosopher, the infant Christ grasps his mother's left index finger in a typically baby-like way as he playfully reaches for the flower that she holds.","Excerpt":"Painted during the latter part of Giotto's career, the Madonna and Child was the central part of a five-section polyptych","YearOfWork":1315,"Width":62,"Height":85,"Medium":"Tempera on panel","Cost":1900,"MSRP":2300,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":61,"green":49,"blue":28},"web":"#3D311C","name":"Mikado"},{"color":{"red":112,"green":73,"blue":28},"web":"#70491C","name":"Antique Brass"},{"color":{"red":228,"green":174,"blue":89},"web":"#E4AE59","name":"Rob Roy"},{"color":{"red":53,"green":48,"blue":40},"web":"#353028","name":"Creole"},{"color":{"red":9,"green":4,"blue":3},"web":"#090403","name":"Black"},{"color":{"red":91,"green":51,"blue":9},"web":"#5B3309","name":"Baker's Chocolate"}]},"ShapeName":"Portrait"},{"PaintingID":598,"ArtistID":141,"FirstName":"Agnolo","LastName":"Gaddi","ImageFileName":"141010.jpg","Title":"Saint Margaret and the Dragon","GalleryID":6,"GalleryName":"Metropolitan Museum of Art","GalleryCity":"New York City","GalleryCountry":"USA","Latitude":40.7794472,"Longitude":-73.963111,"ShapeID":1,"MuseumLink":"http:\/\/www.metmuseum.org\/art\/collection\/search\/436429","AccessionNumber":"41.190.23","CopyrightText":"Open Access for Scholarly Content","Description":"Together with two other small panels, this depiction of Saint Margaret emerging from the mouth of a dragon formed part of the predella of an unidentified altarpiece.

The work was most likely created during the period after the Doni's marriage in 1503 or 1504, as well as after the excavation of the Laocoon about 1506, yet before the Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes were begun in 1508, dating the painting to approximately late 1506 or 1507.

At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian.

Thus there was a demand that the contours in painting be dear and sometimes even sharp. Bronzino's works are considered the epitome of Florentine disegno and, at the same time, its final pinnacle, which had already assumed the character of Mannerism. Bronzino, who was a pupil of Jacopo Pontormo and thus extremely familiar with the works of Michelangelo, served for many years as court painter to the Medici. He created decorations (now lost) for numerous theatrical works and festive occasions and supplied brilliant designs for the Medici tapestry factory. In his composition Bronzino organises the group in close proximity to one another in the foreground. Nevertheless the figures are arranged next to and behind each other in a way that makes them easy to recognise. The infant St. John is in the foremost position, his gaze and gesture pointing to the infant Jesus, who is depicted frontally. Behind them stands St. Mary, who is holding her son's arm in a loving gesture. The composition is extended by St. Anne and St. Joseph, who stand out from the central group of three because of their more natural skin colour. More than in almost any other of his works, Bronzino has emphasised the sharply outlined and sculptural figures almost to the point of stony coldness, especially in the case of the two boys. This artistic decision is also an example of paragone (Italian: comparison) - the competition, discussed in art theory at the time, between painting and sculpture to see which could create the better depiction of three-dimensional forms. Here Bronzino creates exciting contrasts: the coolness and clarity of his composition as opposed to the intimate familiar atmosphere; soft and gentle movements contrasted with formal severity and abstraction; turning away from natural models on the one hand but depicting all of their details on the other.","Excerpt":"Completely in contrast to the principles of Venetian painting, which made colour the dominant means of expression, Renaissance painting in Florence gave priority to the drawing as the means of expressing artistic invention.","YearOfWork":1545,"Width":101,"Height":126,"Medium":"Oil on wood","Cost":900,"MSRP":1200,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":3},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":73,"green":61,"blue":45},"web":"#493d2d","name":"Deep Bronze"},{"color":{"red":193,"green":175,"blue":163},"web":"#c1afa3","name":"Silk"},{"color":{"red":20,"green":33,"blue":32},"web":"#142120","name":"Swamp"},{"color":{"red":84,"green":32,"blue":23},"web":"#542017","name":"Caput Mortuum"},{"color":{"red":44,"green":51,"blue":92},"web":"#2c335c","name":"Lucky Point"},{"color":{"red":177,"green":113,"blue":96},"web":"#b17160","name":"Coral Tree"}]},"ShapeName":"Portrait"},{"PaintingID":499,"ArtistID":100,"FirstName":null,"LastName":"Titian","ImageFileName":"100050.jpg","Title":"Venus and Adonis","GalleryID":27,"GalleryName":"J.

El Greco had lived in Venice and in the Farnese Palace in Rome, where Titian's portraits (such as those of the Farnese Pope Paul III) would have revealed to the Greek painter the psychological possibilities of portraiture.","Excerpt":"This intense portrait depicts Fernando Nico de Guevara (1541-1609), who in 1596 was named cardinal and is dressed as such here.","YearOfWork":1600,"Width":108,"Height":170,"Medium":"Oil on canvas","Cost":800,"MSRP":900,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":125,"green":118,"blue":90},"web":"#7D765A","name":"Kokoda"},{"color":{"red":66,"green":51,"blue":33},"web":"#423321","name":"Clinker"},{"color":{"red":78,"green":42,"blue":45},"web":"#4E2A2D","name":"Heath"},{"color":{"red":112,"green":72,"blue":77},"web":"#70484D","name":"Tosca"},{"color":{"red":151,"green":108,"blue":114},"web":"#976C72","name":"Turkish Rose"},{"color":{"red":188,"green":142,"blue":151},"web":"#BC8E97","name":"Viola"}]},"ShapeName":"Portrait"},{"PaintingID":412,"ArtistID":101,"FirstName":null,"LastName":"Caravaggio","ImageFileName":"101030.jpg","Title":"Supper at Emmaus","GalleryID":5,"GalleryName":"National Gallery","GalleryCity":"London","GalleryCountry":"UK","Latitude":51.5086,"Longitude":-0.1283,"ShapeID":2,"MuseumLink":"https:\/\/www.nationalgallery.org.uk\/paintings\/michelangelo-merisi-da-caravaggio-the-supper-at-emmaus","AccessionNumber":"NG172","CopyrightText":"Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0","Description":"The Supper at Emmaus is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, and now in the National Gallery in London.

In this scene, Judith and her maidservant behead the general after he has fallen asleep drunk. The painting is relentlessly physical, from the wide spurts of blood to the energy of the two women as they try to wield the large dagger. The effort of the women's struggle is most finely represented by the delicate face of the maid, which is grasped by the oversized, muscular fist of Holofernes as he desperately struggles to survive. Although the painting depicts a classic scene from the Bible, Gentileschi drew herself as Judith and her mentor Agostino Tassi, who was tried in court for her rape, as Holofernes.","Excerpt":"Judith Slaying Holofernes is a painting by the Italian early Baroque artist Artemisia Gentileschi completed between 1611-12.

Here, the Earl is seen wearing the attire of a Knight of the Order of the Garter, to which he was elevated in 1633. By his left temple is a black patch, which must cover a scar. The energetic, wilful gesture of the right hand is evidence of his decisiveness, whilst the left hand resting on the sword indicates his watchfulness, necessary to one of the King's inner circle.

It was painted during the late, English period of the artist's career, and is executed well within the traditions of Western European official portraiture. The girls are shown posing statically against a very roughly indicated, generalised background, with just a hint of a decorative landscape. Dressed and coiffed a la mode, they look like true grown up ladies, the eldest holding herself importantly and with a sense of her own importance, just like a lady at court.

With its elegant colour scheme, dominated by cold pearly-grey and silver-blue, and the virtuoso skill in conveying the texture of fabrics and jewellery, van Dyck's painting yet manages to be a very gentle and informal image of two charming girls.","Excerpt":"Anthony van Dyck in this portrait of the daughters of Philip, 4th Lord Wharton, produced a genuinely appealing image.","YearOfWork":1640,"Width":130,"Height":162,"Medium":"Oil on canvas","Cost":700,"MSRP":900,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":66,"green":49,"blue":30},"web":"#42311E","name":"Clinker"},{"color":{"red":23,"green":23,"blue":22},"web":"#171716","name":"Maire"},{"color":{"red":146,"green":129,"blue":106},"web":"#92816a","name":"Squirrel"},{"color":{"red":125,"green":123,"blue":113},"web":"#7d7b71","name":"Dove Grey"},{"color":{"red":60,"green":84,"blue":85},"web":"#3c5455","name":"Oracle"},{"color":{"red":201,"green":188,"blue":181},"web":"#c9bcb5","name":"Pale Slate"}]},"ShapeName":"Portrait"},{"PaintingID":597,"ArtistID":103,"FirstName":"Anthony van","LastName":"Dyck","ImageFileName":"103050.jpg","Title":"William II, Prince of Orange, and his Bride, Mary Stuart","GalleryID":30,"GalleryName":"Rijksmuseum","GalleryCity":"Amsterdam","GalleryCountry":"Netherlands","Latitude":52.36,"Longitude":4.885278,"ShapeID":1,"MuseumLink":"http:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10934\/RM0001.COLLECT.8289","AccessionNumber":"SK-A-102","CopyrightText":"Public domain","Description":"The boy is fourteen and the girl only nine.

Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velazquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velazquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.","Excerpt":"Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid.

The work's complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. The painting shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velazquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velazquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velazquez is shown working on.","Excerpt":"The work's complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted.

She, however, is not the focus of the scene; that is provided by the lady of the house, who has fallen asleep at the table on the left. Her 'absence' has resulted in the rest of the story: the dog is finishing the meat pie that was served on the table, one of the children is filching something from the cabinet on the wall ('opportunity makes the thief'), the little girl's brother is trying out a pipe, and the youngest child, sitting in his highchair, is playing carelessly with a string of pearls. His attention diverted to the side, a young man is trying to play a violin. Young people who continued to live at home were considered suspect in the popular culture of the Netherlands at the time. The prostitute in the foreground has already been mentioned: in a provocative gesture she holds a filled glass between the legs of the man of the house, while he dismisses with a grin the admonishment of the nun (a Beguine?) standing on the right. The duck on the shoulder of the man next to her identifies him as a Quaker, who urges the reading of pious texts. Finally, the pig in the doorway to the kitchen is an allusion to another proverb: 'Neither cast ye your pearls [here: roses] before swine'. Hanging above the heads of these sinners are the symbols of the penalty to be expected for unbridled, lustful behaviour: a sword and a crutch in a basket suspended from the ceiling.","Excerpt":"Jan Steen arranges the various actors as though on a theatre stage.

The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern. The tied-up curtain in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene. There is also an element of trompe l'oeil as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period. The diagonals on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and three-dimensionality. The fact that it is a love letter that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a cittern, a member of the lute\/guitar family). The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; luit was also a slang term for vagina. This idea is further reinforced by the slippers at the very bottom of the picture. The removed slipper was another symbol of sex. The floor brush would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.","Excerpt":"The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern.

The two white doves at her feet contrast a thick impasto surface with the transparent water and cool greens and blues of the foliage.

Her face glows with youth and beauty depicted in translucent whites. The most important motif, and the charm of the composition, is the profusion of roses -- emerging from a bronze vase, decorating her sleeves and hair, and arranged across the bench and on the foreground plane.

Here he created an image of great elegance and beauty, a painting dominated by a mood of romantic dreaminess. The light, mobile, melting brushstrokes convey the soft skin, the greyish-blue silk of the shawl, and the luxuriant feather of the headdress which surmounts the powdered wig. Free, sketchy painting is combined with fine transitions of colour to create an effect something akin to pastel.

Ingres captures the shy reserve of his subject while illuminating through seamless brushwork the material quality of her many fine attributes: her rich blue satin and lace ball gown, the gold embroidered shawl, and silk damask chair, together with finely tooled jewels of pearl, enamel, and gold. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter's husband, Albert de Broglie, a few years after their ill-fated marriage. Pauline was stricken with tuberculosis soon after completion of the exquisite portrait, leaving five sons and a grieving husband. Through Albert's lifetime, it was draped in fabric on the walls of the family residence.","Excerpt":"Ingres captures the shy reserve of his subject while illuminating through seamless brushwork the material quality of her many fine attributes: her rich blue satin and lace ball gown, the gold embroidered shawl, and silk damask chair, together with finely tooled jewels of pearl, enamel, and gold.","YearOfWork":1851,"Width":121,"Height":91,"Medium":"Oil on canvas","Cost":1100,"MSRP":1400,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":51,"green":54,"blue":43},"web":"#33362B","name":"Eternity"},{"color":{"red":36,"green":84,"blue":129},"web":"#245481","name":"Bahama Blue"},{"color":{"red":88,"green":84,"blue":63},"web":"#58543F","name":"Panda"},{"color":{"red":206,"green":195,"blue":162},"web":"#CEC3A2","name":"Double Spanish White"},{"color":{"red":115,"green":162,"blue":182},"web":"#73A2B6","name":"Glacier"},{"color":{"red":173,"green":144,"blue":52},"web":"#ad9034","name":"Reef Gold"}]},"ShapeName":"Portrait"},{"PaintingID":520,"ArtistID":7,"FirstName":"Eugene","LastName":"Delacroix","ImageFileName":"007003.jpg","Title":"Lion Hunt in Morocco","GalleryID":24,"GalleryName":"Hermitage Museum","GalleryCity":"St. Petersburg","GalleryCountry":"Russia","Latitude":59.941,"Longitude":30.3129,"ShapeID":3,"MuseumLink":"https:\/\/www.hermitagemuseum.org\/wps\/portal\/hermitage\/digital-collection\/01.+Paintings\/37102\/?lng=en","AccessionNumber":3853,"CopyrightText":"Personal non-commercial use","Description":"Delacroix took the subject for this painting from his recollections of the journey through Morocco in 1832. In the foreground he depicted two hunters - a man and a youth - beneath the luxurious crown of a tree, as well as two Arabs in the background with a horse. The outlines of the figures and the rock, the twisted trunks of the trees create a sense of tension. The rifle in the hands of one of the hunters and the unsheathed sabre lying on the ground emphasize that things are coming to an end. The dramatism so typical of Romanticism is created here by energetic brushstrokes and the contrast of complementary colours - red and green, blue and orange - and light and dark patches: the dark green foliage and shaded rock seem to be more tangible in contrast with the sky and the mountain stream.","Excerpt":"Delacroix took the subject for this painting from his recollections of the journey through Morocco in 1832.","YearOfWork":1854,"Width":92,"Height":74,"Medium":"Oil on canvas","Cost":700,"MSRP":900,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":2,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":26,"green":21,"blue":19},"web":"#1A1513","name":"Wood Bark"},{"color":{"red":145,"green":18,"blue":23},"web":"#911217","name":"Carmine"},{"color":{"red":115,"green":70,"blue":25},"web":"#734619","name":"Antique Brass"},{"color":{"red":136,"green":119,"blue":64},"web":"#887740","name":"Shadow"},{"color":{"red":225,"green":196,"blue":105},"web":"#E1C469","name":"Chenin"},{"color":{"red":140,"green":170,"blue":128},"web":"#8CAA80","name":"Amulet"}]},"ShapeName":"Square"},{"PaintingID":214,"ArtistID":133,"FirstName":"Ferdinand Georg","LastName":"Waldm\u00fcller","ImageFileName":"133050.jpg","Title":"The Conscript\u2019s Farewell","GalleryID":82,"GalleryName":"Leopold Museum","GalleryCity":"Vienna","GalleryCountry":"Austria","Latitude":48.202635,"Longitude":16.359088,"ShapeID":2,"MuseumLink":"https:\/\/www.leopoldmuseum.org\/en\/leopoldcollection\/focus\/19century","AccessionNumber":634,"CopyrightText":"&copy; Leopold Museum","Description":"","Excerpt":"","YearOfWork":1854,"Width":74,"Height":59,"Medium":"Oil on wood","Cost":290,"MSRP":350,"WikiLink":"","JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":115,"green":74,"blue":54},"web":"#734A36","name":"Cape Palliser"},{"color":{"red":177,"green":151,"blue":125},"web":"#B1977D","name":"Sandrift"},{"color":{"red":103,"green":38,"blue":14},"web":"#67260E","name":"Baker's Chocolate"},{"color":{"red":90,"green":124,"blue":136},"web":"#5a7c88","name":"Hoki"},{"color":{"red":100,"green":81,"blue":60},"web":"#64513C","name":"Rock"},{"color":{"red":161,"green":61,"blue":46},"web":"#a13d2e","name":"Rock Spray"}]},"ShapeName":"Landscape"},{"PaintingID":182,"ArtistID":10,"FirstName":"Gustave","LastName":"Courbet","ImageFileName":"010060.jpg","Title":"The Painter's Studio; A Real Allegory","GalleryID":19,"GalleryName":"Musee d'Orsay","GalleryCity":"Paris","GalleryCountry":"France","Latitude":48.86,"Longitude":2.327,"ShapeID":4,"MuseumLink":"http:\/\/www.musee-orsay.fr\/en\/collections\/works-in-focus\/search\/commentaire\/commentaire_id\/latelier-du-peintre-7091.html","AccessionNumber":"RF 2257","CopyrightText":"&copy; Home","Description":"The Artist's Studio: A Real Allegory of a Seven Year Phase in my Artistic and Moral Life is an allegory of Coubet's life as a painter, seen as an heroic venture, in which he is flanked by friends and admirers on the right, and challenges and opposition to the left.

The Castello Alfonso, on a small island nearby, deeply impressed him during his stay. When the young, widowed Marie Berna visited Bocklin's studio in Florence in 1880 and asked for a 'picture to dream by,' the memory of that landscape must have merged with earlier memories of, for example, the islands of the dead like San Michele in Venice and Etruscan cliff-necropolises. The Isle of the Dead became one of Bocklin's most popular pictorial works. He achieved this by combining a limited number of ideas into an impressive atmospheric composition. The motifs - island, water, and castle or villa by the sea - are already familiar from many of his earlier works. However, in this case they have been concentrated into a statement of the artist's Weltanschauung. The location is sinister. The viewer's gaze is led up the steps but can penetrate no further into the darkness. The island's strict symmetry, the calm horizontals and verticals, the circular island surrounded by high cliff walls, and the magical lighting create an atmosphere that is both solemn and sublime, evoking a sense of stillness and other-worldliness. The ripple-less surface of the water and the boat bearing the coffin with a figure shrouded in white behind it add a melancholy tone to the whole.","Excerpt":" The Isle of the Dead became one of Bocklin's most popular pictorial works.

The isolated figures and their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with the trees, and austere boundary walls and buildings, are presented in a formal layout.

He captured views of Giverny in numerous canvases. A year before he painted this work in 1886, Monet had already shown a field of poppies (\"Poppy Field\", 1885; Paul Mellon Collection, USA), but without the haystack. The Hermitage work is one of the first of his paintings to show the haystack, which was to be the subject of whole series of works. Monet in virtuoso style captures the fine nuances of effects of light and air, picking the very moment at which the weather is changing and the horizon brightening on an overcast, windy day. The Impressionists painted such overcast weather with bright, light colours, which enabled them to capture the translucent sky and bring out the endlessly rich nuances of colour.","Excerpt":"The Hermitage work is one of the first of his paintings to show the haystack, which was to be the subject of whole series of works.","YearOfWork":1886,"Width":81,"Height":60,"Medium":"Oil on canvas","Cost":700,"MSRP":900,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":200,"green":189,"blue":188},"web":"#C8BDBC","name":"Silver"},{"color":{"red":169,"green":155,"blue":97},"web":"#A99B61","name":"Barley Corn"},{"color":{"red":103,"green":124,"blue":82},"web":"#677C52","name":"Willow Grove"},{"color":{"red":42,"green":55,"blue":54},"web":"#2A3736","name":"Aztec"},{"color":{"red":189,"green":139,"blue":92},"web":"#bd8b5c","name":"Twine"},{"color":{"red":208,"green":131,"blue":88},"web":"#d08358","name":"Burning Sand"}]},"ShapeName":"Landscape"},{"PaintingID":153,"ArtistID":14,"FirstName":"Pierre Auguste","LastName":"Renoir","ImageFileName":"014030.jpg","Title":"Large Bathers","GalleryID":13,"GalleryName":"Philadelphia Museum of Art","GalleryCity":"Philadelphia","GalleryCountry":"USA","Latitude":39.966,"Longitude":-75.181,"ShapeID":2,"MuseumLink":"http:\/\/www.philamuseum.org\/collections\/permanent\/59196.html","AccessionNumber":"1963-116-13","CopyrightText":"Public Domain","Description":"Renoir labored over this painting for a period of three years before he was happy with its composition.

The cropped composition, divided into broad areas of vivid color with monumental irises overflowing its borders, was probably influenced by the decorative patterning of Japanese woodblock prints. Each one of Van Gogh's irises is unique. He carefully studied their movements and shapes to create a variety of curved silhouettes bounded by wavy, twisting, and curling lines.

The exotic world of Oceania had captured the artist's imagination with its harmony of man and nature, with what he saw as the preservation of primitive simplicity. This work captures his recollections of Tahiti and his romantic dreams of the harmony of all on earth. The Tahitian girls symbolise different stages in life. The young islander with the halo above her head, deep in sleep, is the embodiment of virgin purity, while the second girl with the fruit in her hand, ready to take a bite, is like Eve. In the depths of the landscape islanders are dancing around an idol, some mysterious ancient god. The canvas reveals the artist's very individual style with its pure colours applied in generalised flat areas which, like the lines, are subjugated to a single rhythm.","Excerpt":"Gauguin returned from his first stay in Tahiti (1891-1893) to spend nearly two years in Paris, where he painted this work.","YearOfWork":1894,"Width":100,"Height":74,"Medium":"Oil on canvas","Cost":700,"MSRP":900,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":93,"green":82,"blue":57},"web":"#5D5239","name":"West Coast"},{"color":{"red":145,"green":57,"blue":33},"web":"#913921","name":"Fire"},{"color":{"red":41,"green":51,"blue":75},"web":"#29334B","name":"Bunting"},{"color":{"red":176,"green":141,"blue":149},"web":"#B08D95","name":"Viola"},{"color":{"red":149,"green":99,"blue":56},"web":"#956338","name":"McKenzie"},{"color":{"red":123,"green":78,"blue":39},"web":"#7B4E27","name":"Korma"}]},"ShapeName":"Landscape"},{"PaintingID":490,"ArtistID":129,"FirstName":"Lawrence","LastName":"Alma-Tadema","ImageFileName":"129030.jpg","Title":"Spring","GalleryID":27,"GalleryName":"J.

He has also tried to create a dynamic but balanced relationship between complementary colours, such as blue and orange, red and green. Complementary colours 'complete' each other: they are at their most intense when placed together. Matisse adjusted his colours to obtain the maximum intensity. This non-naturalistic use of colour can be seen as a radical development of certain aspects of Impressionist art, and it led the critics to dub Matisse a 'fauve' (wild beast).","Excerpt":"Using vivid, apparently arbitrary, colours, Matisse has captured the sensation of sunlight striking the sitter's face and casting a heavy shadow down one side.","YearOfWork":1905,"Width":39,"Height":29,"Medium":"Oil on canvas","Cost":523,"MSRP":700,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":135,"green":151,"blue":185},"web":"#8797B9","name":"Rock Blue"},{"color":{"red":199,"green":147,"blue":124},"web":"#c7937c","name":"Feldspar "},{"color":{"red":209,"green":188,"blue":159},"web":"#D1BC9F","name":"Soft Amber"},{"color":{"red":137,"green":62,"blue":81},"web":"#893E51","name":"Camelot"},{"color":{"red":102,"green":125,"blue":176},"web":"#667DB0","name":"Chetwode Blue"},{"color":{"red":109,"green":151,"blue":144},"web":"#6d9790","name":"Gumbo"}]},"ShapeName":"Portrait"},{"PaintingID":102,"ArtistID":2,"FirstName":"Henri","LastName":"Matisse","ImageFileName":"002030.jpg","Title":"Joy of Life","GalleryID":37,"GalleryName":"Barnes Foundation","GalleryCity":"Philadelphia","GalleryCountry":"USA","Latitude":39.960659,"Longitude":-75.172523,"ShapeID":2,"MuseumLink":"http:\/\/www.barnesfoundation.org\/collections\/art-collection\/object\/7199\/le-bonheur-de-vivre-also-called-the-joy-of-life","AccessionNumber":"BF719","CopyrightText":"&copy; The Barnes Foundation","Description":"Le bonheur de vivre (The joy of Life), is a painting by Henri Matisse.

His paintings, murals, and sketches are marked by a sensual eroticism, which is especially apparent in his pencil drawings. The painting was started in 1908 and completed in 1915. It is created in an Art Nouveau (Modern) style by use of allegorical painting genre during Golden phase. This is one of Klimt\u2019s central themes, central also to his time and to his contemporaries among them Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele. Klimt makes of it a modern dance of death, but unlike Schiele, he introduces a note of hope and reconciliation, instead of feeling threatened by the figure of death, his human beings seem to disregard it.","Excerpt":"Death and Life is an oil on canvas painting by Austrian symbolist painter, Gustav Klimt whose primary subject was the female body.

T. A. Hoffmann (1776-1822), who was nicknamed \"Ghost Hoffmann\" in his own country. Tale \u00e0 la Hoffmann appears to be loosely based on the poet's best-known lyrical tale, The Golden Pot (1814), a magical story that switches back and forth between high fantasy and everyday life in Dresden. It recounts the trials of the pure and foolish young Anselmus and his efforts to gain entry to Atlantis, the heaven of poetry. The tree from which Anselmus first heard fateful voices speaking to him might thus be on the left. The odd, tubelike construction on the right perhaps represents the glass bottle in which Anselmus found himself briefly imprisoned. The tale's repeated references to time are reflected in the two clocks, and the vessel in the center may stand for the golden pot with the fantastic lily that gives the story its name.","Excerpt":"Tale \u00e0 la Hoffmann appears to be loosely based on the poet's best-known lyrical tale, The Golden Pot (1814), a magical story that switches back and forth between high fantasy and everyday life in Dresden","YearOfWork":1921,"Width":32,"Height":40,"Medium":"Watercolor and ink; oil transfer on paper with gouache and ink borders on cardboard","Cost":600,"MSRP":800,"WikiLink":"https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Tale_%C3%A0_la_Hoffmann_MET_DT1768.jpg","JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":217,"green":195,"blue":136},"web":"#D9C388","name":"Zombie"},{"color":{"red":179,"green":155,"blue":98},"web":"#B39B62","name":"Barley Corn"},{"color":{"red":174,"green":155,"blue":123},"web":"#AE9B7B","name":"Bronco"},{"color":{"red":219,"green":193,"blue":98},"web":"#DBC162","name":"Tacha"},{"color":{"red":208,"green":140,"blue":124},"web":"#d08c7c","name":"My Pink"},{"color":{"red":140,"green":90,"blue":29},"web":"#8c5a1d","name":"Afghan Tan"}]},"ShapeName":"Portrait"},{"PaintingID":16,"ArtistID":1,"FirstName":"Pablo","LastName":"Picasso","ImageFileName":"001190.jpg","Title":"Woman and Child on the Seashore","GalleryID":11,"GalleryName":"The Art Institute of Chicago","GalleryCity":"Chicago","GalleryCountry":"USA","Latitude":41.8794444,"Longitude":-87.62388,"ShapeID":3,"MuseumLink":"http:\/\/www.artic.edu\/aic\/collections\/artwork\/109275","AccessionNumber":null,"CopyrightText":"Estate of Pablo Picasso \/ Artists Rights Society","Description":"Inspired by ancient art he saw while in Rome, Picasso began painting heavy-set figures in a neoclassical mode.

He was also fascinated by American jazz, particularly boogie-woogie, finding its syncopated beat, irreverent approach to melody, and improvisational aesthetic akin to what he called, in his own work, the \"destruction of natural appearance; and construction through continuous opposition of pure means\u00d4\u00c7\u00f6dynamic rhythm.\" In this painting, his penultimate, Mondrian replaced the black grid that had long governed his canvases with predominantly yellow lines that intersect at points marked by squares of blue and red. These atomized bands of stuttering chromatic pulses, interrupted by light gray, create paths across the canvas suggesting the city's grid, the movement of traffic, and blinking electric lights, as well as the rhythms of jazz.","Excerpt":"These atomized bands of stuttering chromatic pulses, interrupted by light gray, create paths across the canvas suggesting the city's grid, the movement of traffic, and blinking electric lights, as well as the rhythms of jazz.","YearOfWork":1942,"Width":127,"Height":127,"Medium":"Oil on canvas","Cost":900,"MSRP":1100,"WikiLink":null,"JsonAnnotations":{"safeSearchAnnotation":{"violence":1,"racy":1},"dominantColors":[{"color":{"red":224,"green":211,"blue":26},"web":"#E0D31A","name":"Barberry"},{"color":{"red":240,"green":240,"blue":238},"web":"#F0F0EE","name":"Sugar Cane"},{"color":{"red":168,"green":49,"blue":38},"web":"#A83126","name":"Brown"},{"color":{"red":73,"green":106,"blue":196},"web":"#496AC4","name":"Free Speech Blue"},{"color":{"red":163,"green":166,"blue":178},"web":"#a3a6b2","name":"Mischka"},{"color":{"red":223,"green":202,"blue":88},"web":"#dfca58","name":"Festival"}]},"ShapeName":"Square"}]
