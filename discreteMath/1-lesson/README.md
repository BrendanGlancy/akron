# Speaking Mathematically: Variables

**_Goal:_** To be able to use + understand language that expresses mathematical ideas clearly precisely, + unambiguously

These variables are similar to those used in computer programming. They can be used as placeholders when you want to discuss something.
They may have one or more values, but you don't know what they are. Or they are used when you don't want to be restricted to considering only a particular
concrete value for it.

### Example:

- Is there a number with the following property:
  - Cubing it and subtracting 9 gives the same result as multiplying by 6?
  - Replace it with a variable

Is there a number x with the property that `x**3 - 9 = 6x`

- You can perform algebra w/ the variable as a placeholder to help discover possible values for x

---

### Example 2:

Given any real number, its square is non-negative.
(replace "it" with "x")

- Given any real number `x, x**2` is non-negative `(or x**2 >= 0)`
- For all real number x, `x**2 >= 0`
