# Build instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/torvalds/linux --depth 1
cd linux
git fetch origin ff1ffd71d5f0612cf194f5705c671d6b64bf5f91
cp ../.config .
mkdir magic
git apply < ../patch.diff
make -j $(nproc)
```
This will clone Linux, check out the commit the challenge is based on, applies the challenge patch, and loads the build configuration.
It then compiles the kernel image accordingly.
