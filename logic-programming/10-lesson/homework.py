# Total Sales
"""
Design a program that asks the user to enter a storeâ€™s sales for each day of the week. The amounts should be stored in an array. Use a loop to calculate the total sales for the week and display the result.

# Lottery number Generator
"""
Design a program that generates a 7-digit lottery number. The program should have an Integer array with 7 elements. Write a loop that steps through the array, randomly generating a number in the range of 0 through 9 for each element. (Use the random function that was discussed in Chapter 6.) Then write another loop that displays the contents of the array.

# Rainfall Stats
"""
Design a program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of 12 months into an array. The program should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, the average monthly rainfall, and the months with the highest and lowest amounts.
