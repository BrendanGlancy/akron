The notes for this lesson are 3 youtube videos
The same with 1.4

For this lesson it would be wise to do the extra practice

Rational Functions - a function that can be expressed in the form 

f(x) = N(x)/D(x)

Non-rational - y=2x+3/x+2(sqrt(x))
Can't have a sqrt in the denominator or fraction

Where the numerator N(x) and the denominator D(x) are polynomials and D(x)
is not the zero polynomial, is called a rational function. The domain of f
consists of all real numbers for which D(x) != 0

Limit notation: limx->af(x)=b "the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is b"

f(x) = 1/x**2
As x -> 0 from the left f(x) -> oo
As x -> 0 from the right f(x) -> oo

This kind of behavior is called an asymtotal behavior

for this function as x becomes large, x->oo and as x becomes small
    x->-oo

This is a horizontal asymtote, the vertical asymtote of this function is
also 0

Vertical Asymtote (VA)
The graph will have a vertical asymtote at x=a if the denominator is 0
at x=a and the numerator isn't zero at x=a

Horizontal Asymtote 
if n<m , then the x axis is the horizontal asymtote

if n=m , y=a/b , then the line is the horizontal asymtote
    Take the coefficents and divide them to find the line
    for example x**2-6x+8/x**2-x-12
        The coefficents would be 1 and 1

if n>m , there will be no horizontal asymtotes

If n is larger than 1 then m (n=m+1), then the graph has an OBLIQUE Asymtote
A graph may have a horizontal asymtote or oblique asymtote, but not both at
the same time

To find the Oblique Asymtote do long division or synthetic (if possible), 
disregard remainder

    oblique asymtote is the line y = quotient

Not sure what synthetic division is

If you find a horizontal asymtote then there is no oblique asymtote

If you plug in one of the numbers you reject to the numerator and it = 0
then that number is not your vertical symtote

Going to the table, on graphing calculator if there is an error, there will
be a hole or open dot
