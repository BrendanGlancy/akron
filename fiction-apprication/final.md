# We Need to explain why these Stories deserve their letter grade

1. There There
    - Really Captivating story, can change your perception on Native American Culture. 
    - I didn't think I'd like this story when I read the prologue but given 
2. The Mine
    - Makes you consider the possibility of real life ghosts and monsters, maybe they're not physical but live inside of us
3. Treasure Island Alley
    - Makes you think about death in a positive light, as well as looking back at your life being able to accept traumatizing things in your past
5. Annunciation
    - Makes you think about circumstance, and sometimes you don't realize how lucky you are until its too late
4. A visit from the Goon Squad
    - Interesting take on the passage of time, and time being the one constant we all have to deal with
6. My Brother William
    - Siblings growing apart but finding a way to stay close, deals with modern technology and isolation
7. Salvage the Bones
    - The devastation hurricane Katrina caused, a family learning how much they love one another despite their differences
8. Moon
    - Interesting take on K-pop culture, and how it can be a way to escape from reality
9. The Master Mourner
    - Interesting tale of a guy who's name I forget, but there are 2 twist that were pretty interesting 1 his brother died in a concentration camp and something about the authors dad maybe killing himself, it was implied but they got a little too fancy with it
10. This Isn't the Actual Sea
    - Hard to follow story about a failing friendship, hard to relate to as a 20 year old college student
11. The Company of Others
    - Mother goes on a journey to find herself, entirely uninteresting and makes me resent the mother
12. The Muddle
    - Was so uninteresting it was hard to read
13. Tender
    - Just couldn't relate so I found it uninteresting
14. Compromisos
    - Parts of it I found kind of gross, sex scene was unnecessary and it just wasn't good overall I could argue it

### Introduction

- This is a paper. It requires an Introduction. Do not just jump into your rankings.
- Your introduction should discuss you as a reader, especially your likes and dislikes.
- Your criteria for your rankings should spring from your likes and dislikes. Remember the elements of a work of fiction that produce enjoyment: plot, theme, characterizations, prose style, atmosphere, setting, symbols, and allusions.

### Goal

- You will be ranking all 11 short stories, plus the 3 novels, in order of preference, using a letter grade system, “A” being the best.
- You can use ascending or descending order. From worst to first probably works the best.
- You will be giving clear, legitimate reasons for each individual ranking that respond to criteria you select.

### Order

- The position of each story and novel within your rankings should make sense. If you’re telling me strong points of one story, but it is lower in the rankings than a story you thought was just mediocre, I’m going to wonder why.
- It’s okay to justify your rankings by comparing the work to something above or below it. Just don’t forget to evaluate the work.
- Remember, these should be ranked from your least favorite to the most or vice versa. Do not just list them randomly or in the order we read them.

### Common Mistakes

- Not evaluating all 11 short stories and 3 novels.
- Not putting them in order or your order not making sense.
- Inserting incorrect details or misidentifying characters within your rankings.
- Using illegitimate criteria—length, you didn’t like the name of a character, you were tired when you read it, etc.
- Being too general.
- Not including an introduction.
- Being inconsistent with your stated likes or dislikes as a reader.

### About this last point...

- A strong evaluation that is in conflict with the elements identified in the introduction would explain this. For example:
- “Omakase” used a narrative technique that I stated up front I did not like. Weike Wang practically suffocates us by forcing us to see the whole story through the unnamed woman’s eyes. Yet, the struggles she recounts as an Asian woman dating a white man overcame my hatred of this technique. The woman is uncomfortable, but she controls her emotions. The logic of her decisions slowly emerge. There is no big confrontation or climax of any kind, just the realization that she cannot change other people. When her date tells her to stop “overthinking” things at the end, we know that she actually has to start thinking more. It was a very nice way to get a message across.--B

### Conclusion?

- After you get to your favorite story or novel, you can just end your rankings if you so choose.
- Many students do write a conclusion, though, summarizing their experience.
