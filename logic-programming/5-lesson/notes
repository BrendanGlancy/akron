Introduction to Decison Structures

A decision structure (or selection structure) allows a program to perform
actions only under certain conditions

Types of decisions include:
    if , single alternative
    if then else, also called dual alternative
    Case structure for multiple alternative decisions

Relational operators 
x > y, x < y, x >= y, x <= y, x == y, x != y

The case structure lets the value of a variable or an expression determine
which part of execution the program will take

- Can be used as an alternative to nested decisions

else if is elif

the is operator in python, checks to see if the object are the same
two different objects with the same value will return true when the 
condition is == and will return false if the condition is 'is'
