/*
  Project Requirement:
  For a single table [struct] and UI, do data entry and write each record
  Example: "patient demographic record"
  - Subject to me finding the right HL7 or EMR nomenclature
  - SSN, building an alpha string from digit entries
  - Name, alpha firstname and lastname and character middle initial
  - Address: two alphabetic for address, one for city
  - State code, which we will populate and validate later
  - ZIP, entered as digits and then concatenated as either number or string, TBD
  - I expect reasonable validation for each field; "minimal" style
  - OK to do this twice: once with functions in main(), also
