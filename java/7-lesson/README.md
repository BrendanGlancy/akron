# Lesson 7

Method Overloading vs Method Overriding

| Overloading  | Overriding   |
|--------------- | --------------- |
| Access modifier can be same or different   | After a method is inherited it is possible to change.   |
| Return-type can be same or different  | Parameter, and Return-type **MUST** be the same   |
| Parameters **MUST** be different, Methods must be the same   | @Override annotation MUST be applicable. We can use the @Override annotation before the method to declare overriding. This annotation will allow the complier to help ensure the method is overriden correctly.   |
| Any method can be overloaded   | Must happen in the sub class, access modifier MUST be the same  |

Basically went over the last lecture again, see lesson 6 for more notes about classes and objects.
