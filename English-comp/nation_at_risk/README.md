# A Nation at Risk
##  The Imperative for Educational Reform is the 1983 report of the United States National Commission on Excellence in Education.


A Nation at Risk is a 1983 report put out by the Reagan administration that described how America's educational system was failing to educate students well.

Among other things, it recommended that schools become more rigorous, that they adopt new standards, and that teacher preparation and pay be evaluated.

### Standardized Test, track wealth

Purpose a solution, in which we can create a better standardized testing system. 

Over the last few decades, we have adopted a new set of curriculum has been adopted to better suit the standardized test. This has not worked as test score remain stagnant.

Even though our test scores are low, we domaint intellectual property. This is suprising given our small population.

### Intellectual Property

The only area where the US enjoys a trade surplus, other countries send over people to study our education system, dispie our low international test scores.

**Critique**

In 1990, Admiral James Watkins, the Secretary of Energy, commissioned the Sandia Laboratories in New Mexico to document the decline in the Nation at Risk report with actual data. When the systems scientists broke down the SAT test scores into subgroups, they discovered contradictory data. While the overall average scores declined, the subgroups of students increased. In statistics this is known as Simpson's paradox.

### Can the gap between wealth and standardized test scores be improved

**Consider**
- Two similar test scores
- One from a poor district, one from a weatlthy district

### Which is more impressive?

Most would consider the test score from the less weatlthy district to be more impressive, when considering everything that goes into scoring these test
