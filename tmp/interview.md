Eliot & Eric

## Career aspirations
- Talk about how developers in my generation, start with a lot of layers of abstractions (i.e react example)
    - Learning lower level programming, being able to work with someone who has as much passion for coding as I do
- Ultimately, I just want to get better at programming, getting paid to do that sounds really nice

## Strengths 
- On the technical side, based on my piers I interact with at Akron I believe I am a very strong programmer for my level, but compared to Eliot & Eric I hesitate to say that
- At my programming bootcamp I had a lot of experience working with a team of developers as well as pair programming 
- Since I have more experience programming than the typical junior, I have the ability to write more readible code. Also using vim as a text editor I have a little more experience and knowledge of language server protocols so I have the ability to write decent documentation as well as read it
- If something doesn't work ill work on it on or off the clock
- git
- passion, even now without a job and taking around 20 credit hours, I still set aside time to learn new things and try to master skills

## Weaknesses
- This would be my first internship working with a team of developers as opposed to being the solo developer on a project, the only other experience I have with this is on open source projects
- Project management knowledge
- I like to jump around and work on multiple things at once (add) this means that I have to be very careful with my time management and have discipline when something is a priority 

## Why this internship interested me
- Cpp, embedded systems
