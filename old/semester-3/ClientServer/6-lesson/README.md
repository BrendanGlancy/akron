# JavaScript Document Object Model

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language independent interface that treats an XML or HTML documnet as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree.

```javascript
// sets a equal to the url
let a = document.url

// sets b eqaul to the url as well
let b = document["inputEncoding"]
```

## Selection methods in JavaScript
- getElementById(id)
- getElementsByClassName(name)
- querySelector(selector)
- getElementsByTagName(name)
- querySelectorAll(selector)
