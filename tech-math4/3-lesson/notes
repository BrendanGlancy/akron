Increasing, Decreasing, and Continuous Functions

There can be increasing parts of a graphed function, decreasing parts
and turning points where the graph is change from increasing to decreasing or
vice versa

You can have a relative maxium, like a turning point on a function where 
the absolute maxium is oo, same for minimums

Relative maxium point will be coordinate, Relative maxium value is just a 
number

If your Abosolute max or min is oo or -oo, then you say DNE (does not exsits)

When you have a constant, don't use an ordered pair; describe it as (x,x)
x where constant starts to x where constant ends 

Local Minima and Local Maxima:

    A function f is an increasing function on an open interval if f(b) > f(a)
    for any two input values a and b in the given interval where b > a

    A function f is a decreasing function on an open interval if f(b) < f(a) 
    for any two input values a and b in the given interval where b > a

    A function of f has a local maxium at x = b if there exsits an interval 
    (a,c) with a < b < c such that, for x in the interval (a,c), f(x) <= f(b).
    Likewise, f has a local maximum at x = b if there exsits an interval (a, c)
    with a < b < c such that, for any x in the interval (a, c), f(x) >= f(b)

Abosolute Maxima and Minima:

    The Absolute maxium of f at x = c f(c) where f(c) >= f(x) for all 
    x in the domain of f

    The Absolute minimum of f at x =d if f(d) where f(d) <= f(x) for all x
    in the domain of f

We spent the first 15 minutes going over old homework that I got 100% on

Local extremum and relative extremum:

In the window settings you can change what you see on the graphing, when
graphing with calculator

If you have find the relative min and max 4x^{5}-3x^{3}-2x of this function 
You have to approximate

You can use the trace point to approximate
