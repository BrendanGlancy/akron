The notes for this lesson are 3 youtube videos
The same with 1.4

For this lesson it would be wise to do the extra practice

Rational Functions - a function that can be expressed in the form 

f(x) = N(x)/D(x)

Non-rational - y=2x+3/x+2(sqrt(x))
Can't have a sqrt in the denominator or fraction

Where the numerator N(x) and the denominator D(x) are polynomials and D(x)
is not the zero polynomial, is called a rational function. The domain of f
consists of all real numbers for which D(x) != 0

Limit notation: limx->af(x)=b "the limit of f(x) as x approaches a is b"

f(x) = 1/x**2
As x -> 0 from the left f(x) -> oo
As x -> 0 from the right f(x) -> oo

This kind of behavior is called an asymtotal behavior

for this function as x becomes large, x->oo and as x becomes small
    x->-oo

This is a horizontal asymtote, the vertical asymtote of this function is
also 0

Vertical Asymtote (VA)
The graph will have a vertical asymtote at x=a if the denominator is 0
at x=a and the numerator isn't zero at x=a

Horizontal Asymtote Rules
if n<m , then the x axis is the horizontal asymtote

if n=m , y=a/b , then the line is the horizontal asymtote
    Take the coefficents and divide them to find the line
    for example x**2-6x+8/x**2-x-12
        The coefficents would be 1 and 1

if n>m , there will be no horizontal asymtotes

If n is larger than 1 then m (n=m+1), then the graph has an OBLIQUE Asymtote
A graph may have a horizontal asymtote or oblique asymtote, but not both at
the same time

To find the Oblique Asymtote do long division or synthetic (if possible), 
disregard remainder

    oblique asymtote is the line y = quotient

Not sure what synthetic division is

If you find a horizontal asymtote then there is no oblique asymtote

If you plug in one of the numbers you reject to the numerator and it = 0
then that number is not your vertical symtote

Going to the table, on graphing calculator if there is an error, there will
be a hole or open dot

-- 1.4 notes --

Picking up where we left off

Vertical Asymtotes come when x is not in the domain, so the functions isn't
continuious. AKA whole in the graph

She wants us to do example D for extra practice
to find the domain of a function set the denominator = 0

Plug in the number that makes the denominator to the numerator, and if it
!= 0 then there is a Vertical asymtote which is x=equation not in function

If n > m, there will be no horizontal asymtote. If n+1 = m then there is an
oblique asymtote

To find this oblique asymtote you divide the numerator by denominator
y = quotient

Synthetic divison - Divison of a polynomial by (x - a)
Take the coefficents, then take the first coefficent times the HA 
then take the result of that and add it to the next coefficent, then
times the first result (which is the first coefficent * horizontal asymtote)
and multiply the two together

Example in written notes 1.4 ^^

in synthetic division you must include all of the degrees so if x**4
then you must include x**3 x**2 x**1 and a constant

Solutions for HA VA or OA must be in the real number system or we reject

If you don't have a perfect sqaure then you can just leave the equation as 
is, unless it specifically says you can approximate

Piecewise functions - A function defined with different formualas in 
different parts of the domain 

When you have a piecewise function, it is wise to graph to get a visual of 
the functions

You can kind of matplot lib a piecewise function, its not very hard but IDK
how accurate is it

Piecewise functions Evaluations are not very hard you just plug in what it
tells you to plug in
Make sure when you graph your piecewise function passes the vertical line 
test

If you don't see a circle the funciton is continuious
