Increasing, Decreasing, and Continuous Functions

Abosolute Maxima and Minima:

    The Absolute maxium of f at x = c f(c) where f(c) >= f(x) for all 
    x in the domain of f

    The Absolute minimum of f at x =d if f(d) where f(d) <= f(x) for all x
    in the domain of f

We spent the first 15 minutes going over old homework that I got 100% on
