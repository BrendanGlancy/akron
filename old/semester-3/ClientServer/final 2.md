List any five types of security threats or vulnerabilities of an information system.

1. Malware: Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt computer operations, gain access to personal data, and gain control over a computer system.

2. Phishing: Phishing is a form of social engineering attack where attackers send emails and links in an attempt to deceive victims into providing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details.

3. SQL Injection: SQL injection is an attack technique used to exploit web applications that are vulnerable to code injection attacks. It involves inserting malicious code into SQL statements to gain access to sensitive data stored in the database.

4. Unpatched Software: Unpatched software is any application or operating system that is no longer supported by the manufacturer and does not receive regular security updates.

5. Denial of Service (DoS): A DoS attack is an attempt to make an online service or website unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.

List any five security policies or measures that can be used to mitigate information system vulnerabilities.

1. Security Patches: Security patches are updates issued by software vendors to fix newly discovered vulnerabilities. Regularly applying security patches is essential to protect against attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities.

2. Network Security: Network security is a set of measures taken to protect an organization’s network from threats. This includes configuring routers and firewalls to block malicious traffic, using an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and respond to suspicious activity, and deploying antivirus software to protect endpoints from malware.

3. Data Encryption: Data encryption is the process of converting data into a form that is unreadable by unauthorized parties. This prevents attackers from being able to access data even if they manage to breach the system.

4. Access Control: Access control is the process of restricting who has access to a system, what they can do with the system, and when they can access it. This helps prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to data and systems.

5. Security Training: Security training is essential for any organization to ensure their staff understand the risks posed by cyber threats and are aware of the security measures they need to take to protect the organization’s data.

list more 6. User Authentication: User authentication is the process of verifying that a user is who they say they are. This can be done using passwords, tokens, biometrics, or a combination of methods.

7. Network Segmentation: Network segmentation is the process of dividing a network into smaller sub-networks, or segments, in order to reduce the attack surface of the system and minimize the impact of a security breach.

8. Application Firewalls: An application firewall is a type of firewall specifically designed to protect web applications from malicious traffic. It monitors and filters incoming traffic to block malicious requests.

9. Vulnerability Scanning: Vulnerability scanning is the process of identifying potential security flaws in an organization’s systems and networks. This helps organizations identify and address weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers.

10. Log Monitoring: Log monitoring is the process of collecting, analyzing, and reviewing log files from various systems and applications. This helps organizations detect suspicious activity, investigate security incidents, and improve security policies.

What are the three main components or principles of information security?

1. Confidentiality: Confidentiality is the principle of ensuring that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized parties.
