* Description: Assignment 4:
Using embedded JavaScript in HTML5, prompt users to enter the name of a patient in a health center, age of the patient, number of days to be admitted at the center, and the cost per day of admittance.

Calculate the total cost of service rendered to the patient based on the information above.  The total cost will be calculated as: (days * cost). There are discounts to the cost per day and that must determined using a function to calculate the return the discounted cost per day.

The discount function must take two arguments for the patient age and cost per day of admittance before returning the calculated discounted cost per day from the function.
•	If the patient is over the age of 50,
    a 15% discount should be applied to the cost per day.
•	If the patient is between the ages of 31 and 50,
    the discount must be 10%.
•	Patients between the ages of 21 and 30 should also get a 5% discount
•	All patients below the age of 21 get a 20% discount on the cost per day.

The following data should also be displayed: patient name, patient age, cost per day, discounted total cost.
