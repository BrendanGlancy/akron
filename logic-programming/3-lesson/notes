Modules, in python they're functions 

Divide and conquer to make your code more readiable
It's easier to tackle smaller tasks individually 

Most programs are large enough to be broken down into several 
subtasks

Benefits:
    Simpler 
    Code reuse 
    Better testing
    Faster Devlopment
    Easier facilitation of teamwork
    Easier Maintenance


Module showMessage()
    display "Hello World"
End Module

Call showMessage()

Main method python:

def main():
    print("Hello World!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

A modules name should be descriptive enough so that anyone reading the code
can guess what the module does

No spaces in a module name
No punctuation 
Cannot begin with a number

In flowcharts modules are serpate, they are their own flowcharts

Hierarchy charts are a thing now

Scope is the part of the program in which the variable can be accessed

Local and Global variables

local variables cannot be accessed outside of their method
Global are declared in the main method, can be accessed by other methods

4 principles of object-oriented Programming:
Encapsulation, Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance

Argument is any piece of data that is passed into a module when the module
is called

Parameter is a variable that recieves an argument that is passed into a 
module 

Multuple arguments can be passed sequentially into a parameter list

Pass by Value mean that only a copy of the argument's value is passed into 
the module 

Pass by reference means the argument is passed into a reference variable
