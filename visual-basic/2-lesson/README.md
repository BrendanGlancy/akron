# Math Tutor Application

Create an application that displays a simple math problem in a Label control. The
form should have a button that displays the answer to the math problem. It should
also have a button that closes the application. The leftmost screen in Figure 2-98
shows the application’s form before the button is clicked to display the answer. The
rightmost screen shows the application’s form after the button has been clicked.
