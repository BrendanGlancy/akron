An extended metaphor for the empty promises and false hopes offered by
Jeannette"s father, Rex

Creative non-fiction: non-fiction with frosting, embleshed

The Glass Castle symbolizes Jeannette's innocence and the love she has
for her father

Jeannette is poor, they move across the country multiple times to avoid
debt collectors. Her dad makes his money by gambling, and promises a better 
life for his family saying he's going to make them a glass castle. 
He literally has blueprints to build them a glass castle

Where she lives is important, not just the city but her actual homes as well

They move from Battle mountain, to Welch West Virgina to stay with her 
grandmother. You see how influential her dad being an alcholic is on her
life

Jeannette eventually moves to New York and makes it as a writer

You see a transformation of their opinion of their dad
