# We Need to explain why these Stories deserve their letter grade

1. There There
    - Really Captivating story, can change your perception on Native American Culture. 
2. The Mine
    - Makes you consider the possibility of real life ghosts and monsters, maybe they're not physical but live inside of us
3. Treasure Island Alley
    - Makes you think about death in a positive light, as well as looking back at your life being able to accept traumatizing things in your past
5. Annunciation
    - Makes you think about circumstance, and sometimes you don't realize how lucky you are until its too late
4. A visit from the Goon Squad
    - Interesting take on the passage of time, and time being the one constant we all have to deal with
6. My Brother William
    - Siblings growing apart but finding a way to stay close, deals with modern technology and isolation
7. Salvage the Bones
    - The devastation hurricane Katrina caused, a family learning how much they love one another despite their differences
8. The Master Mourner
    - Interesting tale of a guy who's name I forget, but there are 2 twist that were pretty interesting 1 his brother died in a concentration camp and something about the authors dad maybe killing himself, it was implied but they got a little too fancy with it
9. The Company of Others
    - Mother goes on a journey to find herself, entirely uninteresting and makes me resent the mother
10. The Muddle
    - Was so uninteresting it was hard to read
11. Tender
    - Just couldn't relate so I found it uninteresting
12. Compromisos
    - Parts of it I found kind of gross, sex scene was unnecessary and it just wasn't good overall I could argue it
