In the beginning his mother cannot walk. Eggers father is also sick maybe 
already dead, he has to care for his mother who cannot move off the couch.

They flash back to a month ago in Beths perspective, she sees her father in
the driveway kneeling

The house is described: living room kind of classy, but the family room
was a reflection of their true inclinations. Jumbled funiture competing 
with clenched teeth and sharp elbows. Looks like a ships cabin. The walls
are brown except one with a fireplace.

They are watching a show where bodybuilders fight while Eggers holds his 
mothers nose.

His mom is a teacher that most of the kids like.
